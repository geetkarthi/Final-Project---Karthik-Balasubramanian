# Abstract
The main idea of this project was to show the different statistics for each team over the years. These statistics include - xG, xGA, npxG, npxGA, deep, deep_allowed, scored, missed and many more. These stats are all shown with the help of bar charts, with the options given to the user to choose what stats they want to see. There are 6 options. 
These options are:
1. League Table
2. Team performance per season - this includes 2 options in it. They are a. xG performance and b. passes per action
3. PPDA stats
4. League Position over an entire season
5. Regression for team - an extra regression model which gives us predicted result for a team of your choosing
6. Multiple Visualizations - this includes 3 options - a. PPDA vs Points, b. deep passes vs points and c. xG metrics vs Points

These options generally explain themselves, but I'll be providing some explanations down below.
1. League Table - This includes the League table for any league over a particular season , both chosen by the user. Other than this, we also have some visualizations. These include - points visulaization, Win-Draw-Loss visualization and Goals for/against visualization.
2. Team Performance -
